# Solidity Sandbox & Cheat Sheet
This *Solidity Illustrated* cheat sheet is under construction and will look like this Python cheat-sheet [here](https://richard-burd.github.io/python-illustrated/) once completed.

You can download a PDF version of this cheat-sheet [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14xrrOQwRrBVs7flUg1MeC_axKQZRG9lD&export=download), but if you want to search the text with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> on a Mac) then you need to download something like the [free Foxit reader](https://www.foxit.com/pdf-reader/) which is more robust than what browsers can offer.&nbsp;  This is due to the amount of text displayed on a single page.&nbsp;
